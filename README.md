## ðŸŽ¯ Number Guessing Game in C++

A simple console-based game where the computer picks a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program provides feedbackâ€”whether the guess is too high or too lowâ€”until the correct number is found.

### ðŸ”§ Features
- Random number generation using `rand()` and `srand()`
- Real-time feedback on guesses
- Tracks number of attempts
- Beginner-friendly code structure

### ðŸ’¡ How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o guess_game guess_game.cpp
   ./guess_game
   ```
3. Start guessing!

### ðŸš€ Why This Project?
Perfect for beginners learning:
- Basic I/O in C++
- Looping and conditionals
- Random number generation
- Simple game logic
